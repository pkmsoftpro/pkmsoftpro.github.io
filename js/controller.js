These methods in general used block-matching procedures, which first divide the image into overlapping blocks and extract features from each block, assuming similar blocks will yield similar features. Later in block matching step duplicated blocks are tracked down based on their feature vectors. We proposed a binary similarity measures based approach for block matching. BSM feature values are calculated for the overlapping blocks and the blocks with same value of BSM feature are exactly the same. We also present a few preliminary test results we got during testing.",
